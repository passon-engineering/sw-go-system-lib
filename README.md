# Utility Package

The `utility` package provides functions for common utility tasks such as networking, system and other.
## Usage

1. In your project, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your Go project.

2. Use the `go get` command followed by the import path to download the package and its dependencies. For example, if the import path is `github.com/passon-engineering/sw-go-utility-lib`, run the following command:
   ```
   go get github.com/passon-engineering/sw-go-utility-lib
   ```

3. After running `go get`, Go will download the package and its dependencies and store them in your local Go workspace.

4. In your Go code, you can import the package using the import path you identified earlier. For example:
   ```go
   import "github.com/passon-engineering/sw-go-utility-lib"
   ```

5. You can now use the functions, types, and other elements provided by the external package in your own code.
